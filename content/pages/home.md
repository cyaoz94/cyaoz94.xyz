## About Me

Hey! I’m **Casper Ho** — a **DevOps Engineer** who enjoys building reliable, scalable infrastructure and making development workflows smoother. I also work with **Laravel (PHP)**.

### What I Do

Here are a few things I spend a lot of time on:
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Automating and managing cloud resources with tools like **Terraform**
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — Building automated delivery workflows with **GitHub Actions**, **JenkinsCI**, and friends
- **Container Orchestration** — Working with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and containerized applications
- **Cloud Platforms** — Designing and running workloads on **Amazon cloud services** and **DigitalOcean**
- **Monitoring & Automation** — Improving observability and reliability with **OpenSearch** and **Prometheus**

### About This Site

This repository is my little corner of the internet to document (and share) my DevOps journey. It’s built with **Eleventy**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Alpine.js**, and it’s where I write about infrastructure automation, best practices, and continuous improvement — plus the occasional detour into networking, software development, and plenty of debugging.

### My Interests

- Cloud architecture and infrastructure design
- Automation and infrastructure as code
- Open source technologies
- DevOps best practices and tooling
- Building reliable and scalable systems
